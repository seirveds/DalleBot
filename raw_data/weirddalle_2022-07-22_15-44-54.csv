"J.K. Rowling crying in front of a transgender flag","Mrfish31",">Im not a huge harry potter fan but the results and copies sold speak for themselves. Successful does not mean ""good"". Tons of people read and liked the Da Vinci Code, but few critics would describe it as ""creative genius"". The Transformers movies earned hundreds of millions of dollars, but ask anyone and they'll tell you they're poorly written. Rowling literally explains away the *chattel slavery of House Elves* with a ""well ackshually they like doing it, Dobby is just weird and if you free most of them they become alcoholics"". Totally not something that could have been written in 1860s America. >And nothing she says is hateful towards trans . Except for the actions she takes, like consistently retweeting transphobic arguments, even from people like far right Matt Walsh, supporting people who were *definitely* transphobic, and making the villain of one of her later books a trans woman with all the stereotypes that transphobes would apply. She gets upset about people using gender neutral language such as ""people who menstruate"", which isn't even intending to be inclusive of her main targets (trans women who she perceives as dangerous) but the exact opposite (trans men). In her big essay she wrote two years ago, she repeats the tired, transphobic argument that ""self identification will mean men can just come into bathrooms and assault people"", as if someone willing to do that wouldn't just do it now with no ""justification"". Supporting these ""bathroom laws"" as Rowling does *is transphobic*, and their introduction not only leads to rises in transphobia, but also violence against cis women in public toilets who look or dress too masculine, *and* of course would force trans men into womens bathrooms, something I'm sure Rowling would also object to. She also states the transphobic line that TERFS aren't trans-exclusionary because they'd include trans men, the clear subtext being *they force trans men in their definition because they refuse to see them as men.* If, by some miracle, she actually hasn't said anything *specifically* hateful, it is nothing but a technicality. She clearly *believes* it as she's willing to bat *hard* for those who do, shares misleading or outright false studies and supports transphobic practices/legislation such as ""bathroom laws"". You'll find countless trans people who will say that Rowling's words and actions are hateful towards them, and they would know a lot better than you or I. You don't get to tell a black person what is and isn't racist, and you don't get to tell trans people what is and isn't transphobic. Edit: You can, and should, read a Trans-charity's response to Rowling [here](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/news/dear-jk-rowling/).","13"

She's a mediocre writer at best. Her naming conventions are absolutely awful (""Cho Chang"" for your only Asian character? ""Kingsly Shacklebolt"" for the black one? Really?), she over describes fucking everything leading to books 4-7 being twice as long as needed and she does it really poorly (Every bad character is fat, ugly, ""has a face like a man"", every good character is kind, has nice features, etc). She can't write herself out of a corner to save her life (Uhhhh even though I never really needed to mention the timeturners again, I'll just write this paragraph to say *literally every single one of them was neatly positioned in such a way to be destroyed,* and actually it's good thing Cedric died because if he got saved by time travel he would have been a Fascist despite this being the complete opposite of his character).

"J.K. Rowling crying in front of a transgender flag","loqueseanoimporta456","I'll give you my take. I'm watching this from outside so maybe is easier for you to consider my opinion. I don't know about ""the trans community trying to kill people for their views"". That characterisation is kinda extreme and not conducive for a dialogue, but there's been some insane people on both sides, so whatever. I'll try to articulate my thoughts on the matter if what are you looking for is to understand the issue from another viewpoint. Bare with me, I don't have it refined yet. All I know is that JK Rowling has really dumb takes and cites some really dumb authors. Like ""Trans is the way the patriarchy infiltrates feminism"" dumb. Like ""In biology there are only 2 sexes"" dumb. Grabbing a basic medical book you can find how there's a hundred different ways in which genes, hormones and neurodevelopment contradicts that. That kinda thing is so beyond reality that's doesn't really bothers me much. What really bothers me is the rhetoric use of those talking points. Everytime someone asks if those minorities should have the same considerations as the rest of us they come back with: ""Well, there's only 2 sexes, right?"". Of course, they are talking only about ""scientific facts about biology"" and not about ideology or politics. I don't care if this was only about differences in opinions. When they try to get cute about it makes me lose all my respect. I would respect those people more if they simply said that to them trans don't qualify as persons and be don't with it.","15"

I was just narked that [this Instagram account](https://instagram.com/weirddalleimages?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) (which doesn’t seem to be officially connected to the subreddit?) was getting thousands of likes for images we’d posted here, whilst I’d be lucky to get more than 20 likes on Instagram. It’s a bit petty, I know, and it isn’t like I spend hours and days painstakingly creating these images by hand, but unless you get very lucky, it can still take hours to get the “hot post” worthy images out of it. It just seems to me it’d take minimal effort to credit people for the images, or at least point back to the subreddit so people could see our other efforts, and who created them, and join the community. I was so happy to top the hot posts here in the past, but that was then sullied by seeing someone else getting even more likes for my posts on Instagram. Adding the watermark takes no extra time with the shortcut I wrote to post to Instagram and Twitter, so so I thought “why not?”.
